# Connect4 with Speech Recognition
We are creating an innovative and engaging gaming experience by combining the timeless joy of the beloved Connect 4 game with modern technology. This project offers a standard Connect 4 game, but what makes it unique is its use of speech recognition technology. Simply speaking allows players to make moves, increasing accessibility and interaction. A graphical user interface (GUI) that is easy to understand has been created to improve the overall user experience. This facilitates gameplay and makes navigating simple and intuitive. In addition, the GUI provides a selection of game types, such as the ability to play local multiplayer matches or against a CPU opponent of varying difficulties. Adding an screenshot or a mockup of your application in action would be nice.
