# Connect4 with Speech Recognition

Welcome to Connect4 with Speech Recognition, where we blend the classic Connect 4 game with cutting-edge speech recognition technology. This project not only brings you the nostalgic enjoyment of Connect 4 but also adds a modern twist by allowing players to make moves using their voice. The inclusion of a graphical user interface (GUI) enhances the overall gaming experience, providing a seamless and intuitive way to play. With the addition of a multi-level difficulty AI, players with competitive spirits will be challenged as they increase their AI opponent's difficulty.
